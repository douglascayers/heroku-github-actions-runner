# When we push our code to Heroku, rather than buildpacks
# take over and compile/build our app, we instead tell Heroku
# to build a Docker image and host that container.

build:
  docker:
    runner: Dockerfile

# Note, in private spaces the 'run:' setting is ignored in heroku.yml.
# Instead, Heroku uses the 'CMD' or `ENTRYPOINT` setting in your Dockerfile.
